Very simple bare bones DropBox files downloader for my good ol' Pocket Book Pro 912

Usage:
1. Copy DropBoxSync.app to /applications
2. Create an app on DropBox Developer site and generate an API key
3. Edit DropBoxSync.json so that api_key is set to the generated api key and
   sync_dir is set to the desired download path (e.g. /mnt/ext1/Books/DropBox)
4. Copy DropBoxSync.json to profile config path (/mnt/ext1/system/profile/default/config/ for PB 912)

Restrictions:
1. Download only
2. No subfolders, files only
3. No file updates, existing files are untouched even if the ones in the cloud are newer
